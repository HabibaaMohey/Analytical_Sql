SQL analytical functions provide valuable insights into customer behavior by identifying factors such as product preferences, purchase frequency, and purchase history. These insights can be leveraged to create targeted marketing campaigns that increase customer loyalty and lifetime value.

# Five Analytical SQL Queries
After Exploring Data , i created 5 analytical SQL queries that tells a story about the data with thier buisness meaning to get insights into customer behavior 
and to inform decision-making and drive business growth :

- Top 5 Sold Products
- Correlation between Quantity and Price
- Monthly Revenue
- Top 5 customers in 2011
- Average Customer Order Value


# After exploring the data now you are required to implement a Monetary model for 
Customers behavior for product purchasing and segment each customer based on the below groups 
[ Champions - Loyal Customers - Potential Loyalists – Recent Customers – Promising -
Customers Needing Attention - At Risk - Cant Lose Them – Hibernating – Lost ]

The customers will be grouped based on 3 main values 
• Recency => how recent the last transaction is (Hint: choose a reference date, which is 
the most recent purchase in the dataset ) 

• Frequency => how many times the customer has bought from our store 

• Monetary => how much each customer has paid for our products 
NOTE:
As there are many groups for each of the R, F, and M features, there are also many potential 
permutations, this number is too much to manage in terms of marketing strategies. 
For this, we would decrease the permutations by getting the average scores of the 
frequency and monetary (as both of them are indicative to purchase volume anyway) 

Labeling each customer by :

# The other dataset is daily purchasing transactions for customers Using Analytical SQL answer the following questions:
- What is the maximum number of consecutive days a customer made purchases?
- On average, How many days/transactions does it take a customer to reach a spent 
threshold of 250 L.E?
